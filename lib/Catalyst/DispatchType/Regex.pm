=head1 NAME

Catalyst::DispatchType::Regex - Regex DispatchType

=head1 SYNOPSIS

See L<Catalyst::DispatchType>.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Status: Deprecated.> Regex dispatch types have been deprecated and removed
from Catalyst core. It is recommend that you use Chained methods or other
techniques instead. As part of the refactoring, the dispatch priority of
Regex vs Regexp vs LocalRegex vs LocalRegexp may have changed. Priority is now
influenced by when the dispatch type is first seen in your application.

When loaded, a warning about the deprecation will be printed to STDERR. To
suppress the warning set the CATALYST_NOWARN_DEPRECATE environment variable to
a true value.

Dispatch type managing path-matching behaviour using regexes.  For
more information on dispatch types, see:

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $self->list($c)

Output a table of all regex actions, and their private equivalent.

=cut

sub list {
    my ( $self, $c ) = @_;
    my $avail_width = Catalyst::Utils::term_width() - 9;
    my $col1_width = ($avail_width * .50) < 35 ? 35 : int($avail_width * .50);
    my $col2_width = $avail_width - $col1_width;
    my $re = Text::SimpleTable->new(
        [ $col1_width, $self->_attr ], [ $col2_width, 'Private' ]
    );
    for my $regex ( @{ $self->_compiled } ) {
        my $action = $regex->{action};
        $re->row( $regex->{path}, "/$action" );
    }
    $c->log->debug( "Loaded Regex actions:\n" . $re->draw . "\n" )
      if ( @{ $self->_compiled } );
}

=head2 $self->match( $c, $path )

Checks path against every compiled regex, and offers the action for any regex
which matches a chance to match the request. If it succeeds, sets action,
match and captures on $c->req and returns 1. If not, returns 0 without
altering $c.

=cut

sub match {
    my ( $self, $c, $path ) = @_;

    # Check path against plain text first
    return if $self->SUPER::match( $c, $path );

    foreach my $compiled ( @{ $self->_compiled } ) {
        if ( my @captures = ( $path =~ $compiled->{re} ) ) {
            next unless $compiled->{action}->match($c);
            $c->req->action( $compiled->{path} );
            $c->req->match($path);
            $c->req->captures( \@captures );
            $c->action( $compiled->{action} );
            $c->namespace( $compiled->{action}->namespace );
            return 1;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}

=head2 $self->register( $c, $action )

Registers one or more regex actions for an action object.
Also registers them as literal paths.

Returns 1 if any regexps were registered.

=cut

sub register {
    my ( $self, $c, $action ) = @_;

    $self->_display_deprecation_warning;

    my @register = $self->_get_attributes( $c, $action );

    foreach my $r (@register) {
        $self->register_path( $c, $r, $action );
        $self->register_regex( $c, $r, $action );
    }

    return 1 if @register;
    return 0;
}

sub _get_attributes {
    my ($self, $c, $action) = @_;
    my $attrs    = $action->attributes;
    my $attr     = $self->_attr;
    return @{ $attrs->{$attr}  || [] };
}

=head2 $self->register_regex($c, $re, $action)

Register an individual regex on the action. Usually called from the
register method.

=cut

sub register_regex {
    my ( $self, $c, $re, $action ) = @_;
    push(
        @{ $self->_compiled },    # and compiled regex for us
        {
            re     => qr#$re#,
            action => $action,
            path   => $re,
        }
    );
}

=head2 $self->uri_for_action($action, $captures)

returns a URI for this action if it can find a regex attributes that contains
the correct number of () captures. Note that this may function incorrectly
in the case of nested captures - if your regex does (...(..))..(..) you'll
need to pass the first and third captures only.

=cut

sub uri_for_action {
    my ( $self, $action, $captures ) = @_;

    my $attr = $self->_attr;
    if (my $regexes = $action->attributes->{$attr}) {
        REGEX: foreach my $orig (@$regexes) {
            my $re = "$orig";
            $re =~ s/^\^//;
            $re =~ s/\$$//;
            $re =~ s/\\([^\\])/$1/g;
            my $final = '/';
            my @captures = @$captures;
            while (my ($front, $rest) = split(/\(/, $re, 2)) {
                last unless defined $rest;
                ($rest, $re) =
                    Text::Balanced::extract_bracketed("(${rest}", '(');
                next REGEX unless @captures;
                $final .= $front.shift(@captures);
            }
            $final .= $re;
            next REGEX if @captures;
            return $final;
